# creeperStep
this is simply a fun little five minute project I gave myself. This minecraft plugin once installed will spawn a creeper everytime a block of grass is stepped on
making for an interesting, but overall frustrating challenge in playing the game avoiding dirt

## installation
export as a .jar file, and import into the FTP files of your minecraft server. Ensure the server is running an updated version of Bukkit, and restart your server.

## usage
this plugin requires no external commands to operate, simply just install into the server, no further instruction needed
